# cs-466: Needleman-Wunsch and Hirshberg Comparison 

Our project compares the Needleman-Wunsch and Hirshberg algorithms to determine the space-time complexities. Through exploring the two algorithmâ€™s trade-offs, we will determine if Hirschberg truly optimizes space complexity to be linear (compared to quadratic) when aligning nucleotide sequences.
